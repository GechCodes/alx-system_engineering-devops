Issue Summary

Event Duration: 
- Start Time: November 01, 2023, 14:30 UTC
- End Time: November 01, 2023, 17:45 UTC

Impact:
The outage impacted the authentication service, causing users to encounter login failures. Approximately 30% of users were unable to access the system during the incident.

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication server, leading to the unexpected rejection of valid user credentials.

Timeline:
- 14:30 UTC: Issue Detected
  - The outage was initially identified through an elevated error rate reported by the monitoring system.

- 14:45 UTC: Investigation Initiated
  - Engineers commenced an investigation into the authentication service to pinpoint the source of the increased error rates.

- 15:15 UTC: Misleading Path
  - Initial investigations focused on the database server due to its critical role in authentication. However, database logs indicated no unusual activity.

- 15:45 UTC: Escalation
  - As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the authentication service team for a more detailed analysis.

- 16:30 UTC: Root Cause Identified
  - Engineers discovered a misconfiguration in the authentication server that resulted in the rejection of valid user credentials. The misconfiguration occurred during a recent deployment.

- 17:00 UTC: Resolution
  - The misconfiguration was rectified, and the authentication service was restarted, gradually restoring normal service.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The misconfiguration traced back to an incomplete deployment script that failed to update the authentication server's configuration file. This led to the server rejecting valid user credentials.

Resolution:
The corrective action involved addressing the misconfiguration in the authentication server's configuration file. Additionally, a more robust deployment process was implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
- Enhanced Deployment Process:
  - Implement a more robust deployment process with additional checks and validations to prevent incomplete configurations.

- Automated Testing:
  - Introduce automated testing of critical functionalities during the deployment process to identify and rectify configuration errors before reaching production.

- Monitoring Improvements:
  - Enhance monitoring capabilities to swiftly detect and alert on misconfigurations or anomalies in real-time.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
- Configuration Review:
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of all configuration files for critical services to ensure accuracy and completeness.

- Documentation Update:
  - Update deployment documentation to include explicit instructions on configuration file updates and checks.

- Training:
  - Provide training sessions for the operations team to heighten their awareness of potential misconfiguration issues and how to promptly address them.

- Incident Response Plan:
  - Review and update the incident response plan to include specific procedures for handling misconfigurations and their root causes.

In conclusion, the outage resulted from a misconfiguration during a deployment process, disrupting the authentication service. This incident underscores the importance of robust deployment procedures, thorough monitoring, and continuous improvement in preventing and promptly resolving such issues. The outlined corrective measures and tasks aim to fortify our system against similar incidents in the future.
